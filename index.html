<h1>Bring your bunny</h1>



<p>This event will provide an opportunity for those working on fabrication to meet others and share
their experiences. We encourage them to bring physical objects (fabrication results) to make it a
fun event. We plan to invite people working on fabrication widely using our own connections, but
also welcome anybody interested in this topic.<p>
