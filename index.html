<p>Bring your bunny (or somethins) is a Birds of Feather event organized during the SIGGRAPH/SIGGRAPH Asia conferences. It provides an opportunity for those working on fabrication to meet others and share
their experiences. We encourage them to bring physical objects (fabrication results) to make it a fun event. We plan to invite people working on fabrication widely using our own connections, but
also welcome anybody interested in this topic.<p>
