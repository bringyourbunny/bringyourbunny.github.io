<p>Bring your bunny (or something) is a Birds of Feather event organized during the SIGGRAPH/SIGGRAPH Asia conferences. It provides an opportunity for those working on fabrication to meet others and share
their experiences. We encourage everyone to bring physical objects (fabrication results) to make it a fun event. We invite people working on fabrication widely, but also welcome anybody interested in the topic.<p>
